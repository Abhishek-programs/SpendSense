## Remaining Work

### Step 11: OCR Scanner — V1 (image picker flow)

## V2 — Bubble Overlay (separate effort, Android only)

### Phase 1: Bubble infrastructure (no OCR)
- [ ] `android/.../overlay/OverlayService.kt` — Foreground service + WindowManager
- [ ] `android/.../overlay/FloatingBubbleView.kt` — Draggable green bubble
- [ ] `android/.../overlay/OverlayModule.kt` + `OverlayPackage.kt` — RN bridge
- [ ] `AndroidManifest.xml` — FOREGROUND_SERVICE + media_projection service declaration
- [ ] `MainApplication.kt` — register OverlayPackage
- [ ] `lib/overlay.ts` — JS wrapper
- [ ] Settings toggle (start/stop bubble)
- [ ] **Done when:** bubble appears over banking app, drags, dismisses ✅

### Phase 2: Screen capture
- [ ] `android/.../overlay/ScreenCaptureManager.kt` — MediaProjection → Bitmap
- [ ] `OverlayModule.requestMediaProjectionPermission()` — one-time permission dialog
- [ ] Wire tap → capture → debug toast with bitmap dimensions
- [ ] **Done when:** tap bubble → toast shows "Captured 1080×2340" ✅

### Phase 3: OCR pipeline
- [ ] `android/.../overlay/MLKitOCRProcessor.kt` — ML Kit on captured bitmap
- [ ] `android/.../overlay/OcrResultBridge.kt` — emits `onOcrResult` to JS
- [ ] `hooks/useOverlay.ts` — receive event, log raw text
- [ ] Add ML Kit gradle dep (`com.google.mlkit:text-recognition:16.0.1`)
- [ ] **Done when:** tap over eSewa → toast shows extracted text ✅

### Phase 4: Categorize + save
- [ ] Extend `lib/ocr.ts` with `parseOcrText()` (amount/merchant regex)
- [ ] Complete `hooks/useOverlay.ts` — categorize → addTransaction → toast
- [ ] Add `useOverlay()` to `app/_layout.tsx`
- [ ] Add `'overlay'` to transaction source union + migration if needed
- [ ] **Done when:** silent end-to-end flow, transaction in Ledger ✅
