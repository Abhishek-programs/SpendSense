## Navigation

```
Home | Ledger | [+ FAB] | Vault | Settings
```

Center **green FAB** → Manual Entry / Scan Receipt (not a tab).

---

## Home

**Scroll order:** greeting + checklist banner → **Your money** → **Hero ring** → **Lent & Borrowed** → **Living** → **Future**.  
Headers use safe-area inset (`insets.top + 12`) on all tabs.

### Your money card (collapsed default)
| Collapsed | Expanded |
|-----------|----------|
| **available balance** | **intentional savings** + breakdown (EF, goals, SIP, Shares) |
| | Remaining this month + carried-forward if > 0 |

Net worth accordion: **Lent out** (asset) · **You owe** (liability).

### Hero ring
- **Center:** Safe to spend (locked until salary confirmed this month)
- **Arcs:** green available · red spent · purple lent out (this month) · teal savings (confirmed + unconfirmed)
- **Stroke:** uniform width on all arcs; unconfirmed savings use lower opacity (not a thicker stroke)
- **Orbit chips** (compact, color-only numbers on ring edge, subtle float animation): `{days}d` · spent · saved (saved only when > 0)
- **Legend** below ring labels each arc color (chips are numbers only; legend is the key)

### Lent & Borrowed
- Person-based running balance — not a bucket or income/expense
- Compact row below ring: net balance, tap → `/lending` person list
- FAB third toggle: Lend/Borrow (person, direction, note, date)
- Settle up reduces balance without logging income/expense
- Ledger **Lending** filter shows lend/borrow/settle history

### Living
Core Living, Dates, Fun (budget bars) · Personal (fund bar, rolls over).  
Plain emoji icon column — no tinted icon background. Rows stagger in with `FadeInDown`.

### Future
Savings checklist at the bottom of Home — **EF lives here** (no separate EF card above the ring).

Each row shows:
- Monthly amount + tappable check-off (`__savings_confirm__`; same logic as month-start checklist)
- Thin progress bar + `NPR current / target · %` (EF uses blue accent + shield icon)
- EF + goal buckets: fixed confirm · SIP/Shares: editable amount in detail flows
- Placeholder CTA when no big-spend goal yet

Animated checkmark on confirm; progress bars animate fill width.

---

## Ledger

List / Chart toggle · filters (including **Lending**) · flagged amber border · **description** as main line, merchant as subtitle when different.

**Charts:** sentence-case section titles · `FadeIn` on cards · six-month trend bars with top NPR labels (`overflowTop` / extra card padding so labels aren't clipped) · softer bar radii · non-current trend months at lower green opacity.

---

## Vault

Active goals · Completed (archived) · SIP suggested target when age set · inline monthly edit in detail sheet.  
Goal cards use softened shadows; list rows stagger in with `FadeInDown`.

---

## Manual Entry

Field order: **Amount** (auto-focus) → Bucket → **Description** → Merchant (optional, OCR)  
Manual: remarks empty. OCR: merchant + remarks from receipt.

---

## Settings

Playbook (income, month start, EF floor, age) · buckets · keywords · sure-shot merchants · notifications · **Scan Bubble** (Android) · CSV export · reset all data

### Scan Bubble (Android, dev client)

Requires overlay + app usage + screen capture permissions. See [overlay-v2.md](./overlay-v2.md).

- Toggle enables draggable green bubble over **whitelisted banking apps** only
- Tap → silent screenshot → headless OCR → auto-save transaction (`source: overlay`)
- Default targets: eSewa, Khalti, Chrome (editable in `constants/overlay-targets.ts`)

---

## Onboarding (6 steps)

1. Name  
2. Money — take-home, **cash on hand**, month start, age (optional)  
3. Foundations — **Core Living** → EF target = 6× that, current EF balance  
4. Goals — slider locks after Apply  
5. Bucket builder — income meter, spending + Personal + goals + EF/SIP/Shares  
6. Starting balances — SIP + Shares to date  

---

## Key formulas

```
effectiveIncome      = salary txn amount if confirmed this month else 0
safeToSpend          = spendingPlan - lifestyleSpent - personalDraws + max(0, effectiveIncome - totalAllocations)
availableBalance     = max(0, safeToSpend) + carriedForwardBalance
efFloor              = coreLiving × 6
suggestSipTarget     = income × 12 × max(10, 60 - age) × 0.15  (when age set)
```

---

## UI polish (shipped)

- Uniform hero ring stroke; compact orbit metric chips
- Home reorder + EF folded into Future with progress %
- Living icons without background boxes; animated progress bars
- Safe-area headers on Home, Ledger, Vault, Settings
- Lending screens: consistent 16px card radius, staggered list entrances
